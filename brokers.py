"""Code for figuring out which broker to use.

To define a new broker:
1) Create a new class and define the following method:
  @classmethod
  def parseFileToTxnList(cls, filename, tax_year):
    Note that if tax_year == None, then all transactions should be accepted.
2) If there is an easy way to determine if a particular file is usable
   by your class, then define the method:
  @classmethod
  def isFileForBroker(cls, filename):
    Note that if this method is not defined, then you may need to modify
    update_testdata.py as well.
3) Add your class to the BROKERS map below.
